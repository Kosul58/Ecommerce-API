# Authentication Flow (Signup/Signin)

## Signup

### Route: POST /api/user/signup or POST /api/seller/signup

### Input: JSON with user details (name, username, phone, email, password, etc.)

### Logic:

-> Validate input using Joi.

-> Check if username,phone,email is already used.

-> Hash the password using bcrypt.

-> Save user to DB.

-> Create a cart (for users).

-> Generate a JWT token and return it in the response.

## Signin

### Route: POST /api/user/signin or POST /api/seller/signin

### Input: JSON with username, email and password.

### Logic:

-> Validate input.

-> Find user by username and email.

-> Compare password with hashed password in DB.

-> If valid, generate and return JWT token.

## Token Usage

-> Include token in Authorization: Bearer <token> header for protected routes.

-> Middleware checks and verifies the token.

-> Role-based access control is enforced based on the user type in the token.

# Product Flow
